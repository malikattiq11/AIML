## Real-World Anonymization: Why It's Trickier Than You Think

### The Illusion of Anonymity

Let's look at a typical "anonymized" dataset:

```python
# Original customer data
original_data = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "age": 34, "zipcode": "90210", "purchase": "$299"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "age": 28, "zipcode": "90001", "purchase": "$199"},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Bob Johnson", "age": 45, "zipcode": "90003", "purchase": "$399"}
]

# "Anonymized" version
anonymized_data = [
    {"user_id": "A742", "age_group": "30-40", "region": "LA", "purchase": "$299"},
    {"user_id": "B234", "age_group": "20-30", "region": "LA", "purchase": "$199"},
    {"user_id": "C891", "age_group": "40-50", "region": "LA", "purchase": "$399"}
]
```

Looks safe, right? Wrong! Here's why:

### How Anonymized Data Gets Compromised

#### 1. The Linkage Attack

Let's say we have this "anonymized" health dataset:

```python
# "Anonymized" health records
health_data = [
    {"patient_id": "X47", "age": 38, "zipcode": "90210", "condition": "diabetes"},
    {"patient_id": "Y82", "age": 29, "zipcode": "90001", "condition": "hypertension"},
    {"patient_id": "Z93", "age": 46, "zipcode": "90003", "condition": "asthma"}
]
```

And a public voter registration database:

```python
# Publicly available voter records
voter_records = [
    {"name": "John Doe", "age": 38, "zipcode": "90210"},
    {"name": "Jane Smith", "age": 29, "zipcode": "90001"},
    {"name": "Bob Johnson", "age": 46, "zipcode": "90003"}
]
```

##### How the Attack Works:
1. Find unique combinations in both datasets
2. Match patterns (like age + zipcode)
3. Re-identify individuals

```python
def demonstrate_linkage_attack(health_record, voter_records):
    for voter in voter_records:
        if (voter["age"] == health_record["age"] and 
            voter["zipcode"] == health_record["zipcode"]):
            return f"Found match: {voter['name']} has {health_record['condition']}"
    return "No match found"

# Example usage
print(demonstrate_linkage_attack(health_data[0], voter_records))
# Output: Found match: John Doe has diabetes
```

### Real Attack Examples

1. **The Netflix Prize Dataset (2007)**
   - What happened: Netflix released 100 million "anonymized" movie ratings
   - The attack: Researchers cross-referenced with public IMDB reviews
   - Result: Successfully identified 84% of users [1]

2. **The AOL Search Data Leak (2006)**
   - Released: 20 million web searches from 650,000 users
   - Identification method: Unique patterns in search queries
   - Famous case: User #4417749 identified as Thelma Arnold [9]

### Better Anonymization Techniques

#### 1. K-Anonymity

Ensures each record is similar to at least k-1 other records.

```python
# Bad anonymization (vulnerable)
bad_data = [
    {"age": 28, "zipcode": "90210", "disease": "flu"},
    {"age": 29, "zipcode": "90213", "disease": "cold"},
    {"age": 30, "zipcode": "90215", "disease": "fever"}
]

# K-anonymity (k=3)
k_anonymous_data = [
    {"age_range": "25-30", "zipcode": "902**", "disease": "flu"},
    {"age_range": "25-30", "zipcode": "902**", "disease": "cold"},
    {"age_range": "25-30", "zipcode": "902**", "disease": "fever"}
]
```

#### 2. Differential Privacy in Action

```python
def count_with_privacy(data, query_function, epsilon=0.1):
    true_count = query_function(data)
    noise = np.random.laplace(0, 1/epsilon)
    return max(0, int(round(true_count + noise)))

# Example usage
def count_disease(data, disease):
    return sum(1 for record in data if record["disease"] == disease)

flu_count = count_with_privacy(k_anonymous_data, 
                              lambda d: count_disease(d, "flu"))
print(f"Private count of flu cases: {flu_count}")
```

### Best Practices for Data Anonymization

1. **Use Multiple Techniques**
   - Combine k-anonymity with differential privacy
   - Example: First group data, then add noise

2. **Consider Temporal Aspects**
   - Data over time can reveal patterns
   - Solution: Regularly rotate identifiers

```python
# Bad practice: Static identifiers
user_123_purchases = [
    {"date": "2023-01-01", "amount": 100},
    {"date": "2023-01-02", "amount": 150},
    {"date": "2023-01-03", amount: 200}
]

# Better: Rotating identifiers
user_purchases = [
    {"user_id": "A742", "date": "2023-01-01", "amount": 100},
    {"user_id": "B234", "date": "2023-01-02", "amount": 150},
    {"user_id": "C891", "date": "2023-01-03", "amount": 200}
]
```
